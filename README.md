# File Killer

```diff
-The Python scripts in this repository will make your files unrecoverable. There are several file versions but these will be explained in the Files section.
```
# Files:
### FK.py:

##### It will ask you for every file before overwriting but it isn't overwriting .py files and it will only overwrite files in the same directory.

### FK_WOA.py:

##### Its the normal version but it will automtical overwrite every file (no .py files) in the same directory without asking before overwriting the files.
